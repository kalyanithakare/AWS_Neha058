# Advantages of cloud:

 + **Pay as you go**\
 Pay-as-you-go cloud computing (PAYG cloud computing) is a payment method for cloud computing that charges based on usage. 

+ **You get on demand resources**\
You can scale down or scale up like we can increase or decrease the RAM.

+ **Fast developement and deployment**\
Before some time you had to take the servers on a lease.\
It takes time  to physically transfer the servers.And also for that u have to maintain a temperature , security as well as the electricity , etc . \
so the cloud had removed all these things totally.\
In this,you dont have need to pay for the upfront like security deposit and all. Just go use the resources if u want u can increase the resources.

 + **Outsourced management**\
Administration work is get handled by the aws.\
How to maintain the tempertaure ,electricity all these things are get handled by the aws.

   +  *Provider handles the administration* 
   + *Increased Reliablitiy*: \
    ItMeans our cloud becomes the trustworthy. It gives 99.99999% surity to provide the resources .But in some cases like the natural disasters , their data center is get affected then to save theirselves, they  dont give the 0.0001% guarranty.

   + *Security*: \
Security is also get managed by the cloud.Security is not just related to the hacking. Whenever you have the datacenter you have to do many of the things like cctv,so  that no one should come in our data enter and copy our data, Or we have a security guard to protect our data.

+ **Lower cost**\
As the cloud is pay as you go model , how much you use you have to pay only that much and not more than that.

+ **No geographical barrier.**

 + **No need of the infrastructure**
