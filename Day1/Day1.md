# What is cloud?
**The cloud refers to:**
 >+ Servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. 
 >+ Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. 
 > + By using cloud computing, users and companies **don't have to manage physical servers** themselves or run software 
 > applications on their own machines.

# Different Types of Cloud
>+ ## Private cloud:
 >   + It is owned by one organization.
 >   + A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by one business or organisation.
 >   + The private cloud can be physically located at your organisation’s on-site datacenter or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. 

****Advantages of a private clouds:****
 > 1] *More Flexibility*-Your organisation can customise its cloud environment to meet specific business needs.\
 2] *Improved security*—Resources are not shared with others, so higher levels of control and security are possible.\
 3] *High scalability*—Private clouds still afford the scalability and efficiency of a public cloud.

>+ ## Public cloud:
 >   + Anyone can use it.
 >   + The cloud resources (like servers and storage) are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet. 
 >   + [Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure) is an example of a public cloud.

****Advantages of a public cloud:****
 > 1] *Lower costs*—No need to purchase hardware or software and you pay only for the service you use.\
 2] *No maintenance*—Your service provider provides the maintenance.\
 3] *Near-unlimited scalability*—on-demand resources are available to meet your business needs.\
 4]*High reliability*—a vast network of servers ensures against failure.

>+ ## Hybrid Cloud:
 >   + It is the combinaion of private and public cloud.
 >   + Hybrid clouds combine on-premises infrastructure, or private clouds, with public clouds so organisations can reap the advantages of both.
 

****Advantages of a Hybrid cloud:****
 > 1] *Control*—Your organisation can maintain a private infrastructure for sensitive assets.\
 2] *Flexibility*—you can take advantage of additional resources in the public cloud when you need them.\
 3] *Cost-effectiveness*—with the ability to scale to the public cloud, you pay for extra computing power only when needed.
